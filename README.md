**File Encryptor and Decryptor**

A simple file encryption and decryption script

**How does it work?**
This program consits of two main parts

*Encryption*
If you choose to encrypt it will ask you for:
  - The path of the file
  - The encryption key
  - How many levels of encryption
  - How many files you wish to split it into
 
After which it will output a zip of the encrypted file

*Decryption*
If you choose to decrypt it will ask you for:
  - The zip file location
  - The levels of encryption
  - The key
  - The extension of the file to be created (eg .exe, .png.. ect)
  
  

**This is still a work in progress**
